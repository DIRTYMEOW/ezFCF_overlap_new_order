# ezFCF_overlap_new_order
In ezFCF 1.3 (2026, Jan), after generating *.txt file, the overlap matrix for vibration mode between two states may flipped. Using this code to get the "new_order". Haven't been widely tested, but at least work on the manual one (phenolate photoelectron spec.)


run python new_order.py *.txt, then u get new order, follow Dr. Krylov's manual (http://q-chem.com/Teaching%20Materials/QChemCompLabs/ezFCF_lab-Gozem.pdf) and paste/modify whatever u have to do.
